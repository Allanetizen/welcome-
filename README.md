# welcome-
hey bro, here, we get to learn how to code and code well together.
first, we choose languages, then frameworks and a project to work on.
we start small, like building a calculater or using crud in laravel
we are both expected to be discpline and consistent in our work.
before we start coding; lets learn how to use git. the verson control system. we'll also use a task management tool for our work.. and learn how to use stackoverflow, i hope you already have an account. 
we also need a day to start, my exams end this week, i can be up and running by monday.
